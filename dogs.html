            <h3>Dog Info</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Without a doubt, dogs are superior. They're lovable, kind, playful, and nothing can cheer you up more than a big hug from you pup.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Dogs, or Canis lupus familiaris is a domesticated descendant of the grey wolf. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by humans--over 14,000 years ago. There are about 450 official dog breeds (the most of any mammal) that impact traits including size, skull shape, tail, fur type, color, etc. Popular dog breeds include: bulldog, labrador, golden retriever, german shepard, poodle, rottweiler, beagle, daschund, and more. The average lifespan is between 10 and 13 years, and generally smaller dogs live longer than larger dogs. Like humans, dogs are highly social allowing them to have close interspecie relationships.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">My dog Cleo, who can be seen in the photo in the photo on the left, is my best friend. Though my mom intially wasn't keen to get a dog, Cleo quickly stole her heart by demonstrating her love and loyalty to our family. This is what dogs do... they enter your life and leave a permanent mark, reminding you everyday what unconditional love truly means.</p>
